# Reflow-oven
reflow oven electronics

controller circuit for small baking oven, uses solid state relay for heating and k-type thermocouple for sensing temp
MAX31855 to convert k-type thermocouple data to SPI.

above it is a 2.4" resistive touchscreen, pins are same as in arduino uno, S6D0154 screen driver, cheapest from ebay at the time.

no FAN in the oven (has to open lid manually after done)!!!
I used oven with 1kW of heating power, barely keeps up with profile.
